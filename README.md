### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mathilde, a junior frontend developer, graphic and UX designer currently based in Vienna :ferris_wheel:.
Some of the projects here were implemented during three semesters of Web- and App Development, in which I have gained first experiences with Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular, Kotlin and Swift.
