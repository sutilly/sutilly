### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tilli, a graphic designer currently based in Vienna :ferris_wheel:, who discovered the beautiful, challenging, sometimes very frustrating but also really rewarding world of coding. 
The projects here were implemented during three semesters of Web- and App Development, in which I have gained first experiences with Java, PHP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript, Angular, Kotlin and Swift.
